# generating html blocks for new images
```
python create_boxes.py
```
Re-run this command anytime you need to generate HTML code for new images that you add to ```images/leo```, the create_boxes.py script will generate html code that renders each image in ```images/leo```, copy and paste the content from ```box.txt``` to ```index.html``` right below the comment that says ```<!--Insert code from box.txt here-->```
